Hey there, I'm Charlie, a second-year studying computer science and economics at the University of Chicago. I currently aspire to work as a software engineer, product manager, or researcher somewhere at the cutting edge of technology; however, one day I would love to lead my own venture.

I'm interested in a breadth of topicsâ€”computer science, technology, mathematics, physics, nutrition, and philosophy to name a few. I spend most of my free time studying computer science, more specifically functional programming, category theory, algorithms, and programming languages.

Other hobbies of mine include cooking, specialty coffee, reading, and listening to podcats. Check out my links page for more details!

Currenly, I'm a research intern as a part of [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org/) at UChicago,
assiting with the development of [ProxyStore](https://proxystore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Previously, I've interned as a software engineer a local startup, [FoodFight](https://www.getfoodfight.com/), and as a venture capital analyst at [JUMP Investors](https://jumpinvestors.com/).
