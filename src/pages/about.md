Hey there, I'm Charlie, a third-year undergraduate at the University of Chicago
studying computer science and economics. I currently aspire to work as a software engineer,
product manager, or researcher somewhere at the cutting edge of technology;
however, one day I would love to start my own (bio?)tech company.

I'm interested in a breadth of topics: computer science, mathematics,
physics, literature, neuroscience, and philosophy to name a few. I'm
passionate learner and love it for its own sake.

I like to spend my free time doing new things with friends,
learning new technologies, cooking, over-engineering my coffee brewing process,
reading, and listening to podcasts. Check out Links in the top bar for more specifics.

I have experience working as a software engineer, research assistant, and
venture capital analystâ€”check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-sabino/)
or (possibly out of date) [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vXVFs-rGtJTjWAPjgvHP2E8sORan5Vg7/view?usp=sharing)
for more details.
