Software that makes me happy.

## Dev Tools

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
  - A vastly superior fork of Vim. Highly exensible using Lua. Some of my favorite plugins include Neo-Tree, Telescope, ToggleTerm, cmp, and Which-Key.
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
  - My terminal of choice. GPU rendered, easily configurable, and has built in terminal multiplexing

## Productivity

- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)
  - The best spotlight extension tool for MacOS. Features a vast and free collection of extensions.
- [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)
  - By far the best window manager on Mac. Relies on skhd, and can be configured with Vim bindings.
- [Better Touch Tool](https://folivora.ai/)
  - Easy global hotkey configuration. I use it to automatically launch/switch to the window with specific apps.
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
  - My note taking app of choice. Uses locally-hosted plain markdown files and allows for seemless linkage of ideas. Highly extensible-my favorite plugin is Excalidraw. Built in Vim-like navigation.
- [Concepts](https://concepts.app/en/)
  - My hand-written note taking app of choice. Seamlessly mind-map on an infinite canvas.
- [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/)
  - My email client of choice. Uses Vim keybinds, which, if you haven't noticed yet, I'm a pretty big fan of.
